# Turtle Tennis

A-Level Project involving the design and development of a pseudo-ecommerce application that runs on a local machine.

## Specifications

- Windows OS
- Python v3.8+

## Imports Needed

The application will detect any external libraries and attempt to download them automatically upon starting.

If automatic download fails, the libraries can be installed manually instead:
- customtkinter v5.0.3+ (https://pypi.org/project/customtkinter/)
- fpdf2 v2.6.1+ (https://pypi.org/project/Pillow/)
- yagmail v0.15.293+ (https://pypi.org/project/yagmail/)
- matplotlib v3.7.0+ (https://pypi.org/project/matplotlib/)

## Starting the Application

The application should be started by running the python file titled "app.py".

## Login

A user may log in by creating an account and logging in with that new account. Alternatively, sample accounts of different access levels are 
detailed below:
	
	Customer
		Username: jcurrie123
		Password: HiThere123

	Management staff
		Username: management
		Password: Tt123
	
	Sales staff
		Username: sales
		Password: Tt123

## Images

All images used automatically in the application's UI are located in the 'images' directory.

When creating or updating products, the application will prompt the user for an image. Images can be located in any directory but must be a .png or .jpg file.
